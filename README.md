# C# Encapsulation Issue: Direct Access of Private Fields

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in C# programming: accessing private fields directly from other methods within the same class. While this might seem harmless in simple examples, it can lead to serious problems as code complexity increases.

The primary concern is the violation of encapsulation, a core object-oriented programming principle.  Accessing a private field directly breaks this, making it difficult to maintain, debug, and evolve the code.  Changes to the field's implementation might unexpectedly impact other parts of the class without clear indications.

## The Problem

The `bug.cs` file contains code that directly accesses the private `_myField` from the `MyMethod`. This is the anti-pattern to avoid.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.cs` file provides the improved code.  Instead of directly accessing `_myField`, it uses the `MyProperty` to interact with the field. This properly utilizes the encapsulation provided by the property, allowing for more flexibility and maintainability.

By using properties, we can:

* **Add validation:** We can ensure the assigned value is within a valid range or meets other criteria.
* **Add logging or other side effects:** We can track when the property is accessed or changed.
* **Change implementation details:** We can alter the internal storage or calculations without impacting the rest of the code.
